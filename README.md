# PIML4LBM
Machine Learning LBM Simulation

The assignmnet is to develope a machine learning approach for 2DQ9 LBM method using four of the following approches and validate them using Taylor-Green Vortex test and cavity lid driven test.

  (1) Naive BGK model
  
  (2) Symmetric lattice fetching
  
  (3) Mass & momentum conservation
  
  (4) Combined symmetry and conservation
