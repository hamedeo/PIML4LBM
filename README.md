# PIML4LBM
Machine Learning LBM Simulation
The assignmnet is to develope a machine learning approach for 2DQ9 LBM method using four (1)Naive/(2)Symmetric lattice/(3)mass & momentum conservation/(4)Combined symmetry and conservation approches methodsand validate them using Taylor-Green Vortex test and cavity lid driven test.
